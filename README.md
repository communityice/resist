# Resist I.C.E.
ICE is a [brutal](https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2019/07/02/ayanna-pressley-migrant-detention-centers-texas/) and [inhumane](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/07/border-patrols-oversight-sick-migrant-children/593224/) [organization](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-obtains-documents-showing-widespread-abuse-child-immigrants-us-custody), and one of its detention centers is right at our doorstep. Let’s work to end its cruel practices and protect our neighbors.

It’s time to act.

This list is in its infancy. Please help us expand it with [Issues](https://github.com/ice-here/resist/issues) and [PRs](https://github.com/ice-here/resist/pulls).

### Call your representatives
Find out if you representatives stand for ending ICE’s practices at our doorstep. Ask about their specific, and actionable plans. Communicate your stand.

Here’s a script (taken and modified from [here](https://breakice.org/), but feel free to speak from the heart:

```
Hi! My name is <YOUR NAME> and I’m from <CITY, STATE>. 
I’m calling to let <NAME OF REPRESENTATIVE> know that I strongly support Abolishing ICE, 
an agency with a long track record of human rights abuses. 
I would like <NAME OF REPRESENTATIVE> to voice their support for abolishing ICE, 
and hold the agency accountable for its inhumane and illegal actions.
```

### Call for an end of 287(g) Agreement
287(g) shifts immigrant enforcement duties on local agencies. 
Boston does not have a 287(g) agreement, which is great! However, several places in Massachusetts do, and you might know people that live there and elsewhere with 287(g) agreements.

Check this map: https://www.ilrc.org/national-map-287g-agreements (archived at https://perma.cc/MK74-7RQR)

Talk to your friends about calling their representatives and demanding an end to this agreement.
