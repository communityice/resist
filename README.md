# Resist I.C.E.

ICE is a [brutal](https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2019/07/02/ayanna-pressley-migrant-detention-centers-texas/), [inhumane](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/07/border-patrols-oversight-sick-migrant-children/593224/) [organization](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-obtains-documents-showing-widespread-abuse-child-immigrants-us-custody), and [one of its detention centers is right at our doorstep](https://www.ice.gov/detention-facility/suffolk-county-house-corrections-south-bay). Let’s work to end its cruel practices and protect our neighbors.

It’s time to act.

This list is in its infancy. Please help us expand it with [Issues](https://github.com/ice-here/resist/issues) and [PRs](https://github.com/ice-here/resist/pulls).


**There is a lot to do and we know it's hard.**
If you don't know where to start, we recommend giving your [representatives a call](#call-your-representatives). The more we let our elected officials know that this is important to us, the more pressure we put on them to change the system.

## Call your representatives

Find out if you representatives stand for ending ICE’s practices at our doorstep. Ask about their specific, and actionable plans. Communicate your stand.

Here’s a script (taken and modified from [here](https://breakice.org/), but feel free to speak from the heart:

```
Hi! My name is <YOUR NAME> and I’m from <CITY, STATE>. 
I’m calling to let <NAME OF REPRESENTATIVE> know that I strongly support Abolishing ICE, 
an agency with a long track record of human rights abuses. 
I would like <NAME OF REPRESENTATIVE> to voice their support for abolishing ICE, 
and hold the agency accountable for its inhumane and illegal actions.
```

Contact the Boston mayor’s office:

## Call for an end of 287(g) Agreement
287(g) shifts immigrant enforcement duties on local agencies. 
Boston does not have a 287(g) agreement, which is great! However, several places in Massachusetts do, and you might know people that live there and elsewhere with 287(g) agreements.

Check this map: https://www.ilrc.org/national-map-287g-agreements (archived at https://perma.cc/MK74-7RQR)

Talk to your friends about calling their representatives and demanding an end to this agreement.
